# Contribution Guide

Ezy API is open to contributions from everyone!  
Feel free to follow the steps below to participate.

## Create a Branch

When starting new work, please create a **branch**. Branches are usually named in the format `feature/{feature-name}`.

```bash
# Switch to the main branch and sync with the latest version
$ git checkout main
$ git pull origin main

# Create and switch to a new branch
$ git checkout -b feature/feature-name
```

### Branch Naming Convention

Name your branch according to the nature of your work.

| Type | Description | Example |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| `feature/` | New feature development | `feature/login-api`, `feature/add-user-api` |
| `fix/` | Bug fixes | `fix/login-bug`, `fix/routing-error` |
| `docs/` | Documentation (README, comments, etc.) | `docs/update-readme`, `docs/api-docs` |
| `refactor/` | Code refactoring | `refactor/login-service`, `refactor/db-helper` |
| `test/` | Adding or updating tests | `test/user-service-test` |
| `chore/` | Build settings, package management, miscellaneous tasks | `chore/update-deps`, `chore/ci-config` |

> **Tip**
> 
> Branch names should clearly indicate the purpose of the work.

## Work and Commit

After completing your work, write a commit message following the **commit convention** below.

### Commit Message Convention

| Tag | Description |
|:---:|:---|
| `feat` | Add a new feature |
| `fix` | Fix a bug |
| `docs` | Update documentation (README, comments, etc.) |
| `style` | Code formatting, typos, non-functional changes |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring (internal improvements without behavior change) |
| `test` | Add or update tests |
| `chore` | Build tasks, package manager configuration, maintenance work |

### Commit Examples
```bash
$ git commit -m "feat: add user API"
$ git commit -m "fix: fix incorrect router path"
$ git commit -m "docs: add installation guide to README"
```

## Push to Remote

Push your branch to the remote repository.

```bash
$ git push origin feature/feature-name
```

## Create a Pull Request (PR)

- Create a **Pull Request** on GitHub.
- Briefly describe what you worked on in the PR description.
- Then proceed with a code review with your team.

## Merge

- Once the review is complete and approved, **merge into the main branch**.
- After merging, always make sure to sync your local `main` branch before starting new work.

```bash
$ git checkout main
$ git pull origin main
```
